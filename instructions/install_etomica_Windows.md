# ES140X

## Install etomica modules  

1. Run the command `cd ~/ES1403_class/ES140X/instructions` to get into the directory with these zip files.  
2. We're going to move this folder to your desktop so you have easy access to open the modules. Run the command <br/> `cp -R \mnt/c/Users/YOURUSERNAME/Desktop etomica_modules_windows.zip` <br/>
Please note that you should input your personal computer's username in place of YOURUSERNAME. If you don't know your username, double click tab after getting to the `cp -R \mnt/c/Users/` part of your input, but before hitting `enter` to execute the command. This will give you a list of available directories and you should be able to see your current profile username. <br/> 
3. Now look at your computers desktop. You should see a file named etomica_module_windows.zip. Right click on this folder and select unzip. You should see a new directory on your desktop called etomica_modules.
4. To confirm whether or not your install worked  : <br/>
	Click on the folder to open it up  <br/>
	Click on the folder labeld **bin** <br/>
	Click on any of the files with the extension **.bar**. This will open up the simulation applet.
5. If this doesn't work for you, contact a TA asap because these will be used throughout the class.
