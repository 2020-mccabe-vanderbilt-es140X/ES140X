## Install VMD for MacOS users:

1. Go this link: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD

2. Under version 1.9.4, click on MacOS X Catalina OpenGL (64-bit Intel x86_64)

       a. If you have 10.14 or earlier as your MacOS, download the 32 bit installation under version 1.9.3 MacOS X OpenGL (32-bit Intel x86)

3. Create an account with VMD. Follow the instructions on their website until you download the file.

       a. Download the most recent VMD 1.9.4a43 Rev 6 for MacOS X Catalina

       b. The file you download should be called vmd194a43-MACOSX-Catalinaonly-Rev6.dmg. This is not the case if you downloaded 1.9.3. It will be named vmd193mac86nocuda.dmg

4. Open up this file by double clicking it in the downloads folder of Finder.

5. A new finder window will open up with these two files: `VMD 1.9.4a43 Catalina Rev6` and `VMD User's Guide.pdf` <br/>
Move the VMD 1.9.4 file to your Applications folder. Just open up a new finder window and navigate to Applications. It should be selectable on the left column of shortcuts. Click and drag the VMD 1.9.4 into that Applications folder. Then, in applications, double click on the red and white icon to open VMD.

6. Some people might have security settings on that will block opening a file downloaded from the internet. If this is the case, find the VMD icon in your applications folder. Instead of double clicking on it right click (control-click) on the icon and select the open option. A pop up will ask if you want to continue with opening VMD and select Open. Then the VMD window will pop up and youâ€™ll be good to go!
