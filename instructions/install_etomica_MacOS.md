# ES140X

## Install etomica modules for MacOS

1. Run `cd ~/ES1403_class/ES140X/instructions` which is where the zip file for the software is located  
3. Run `unzip etomica_modules_macos.zip`
4. To confirm whether or not your install worked  
	`cd etomica_modules/bin'`  
	`./pistoncylinder`  
5. This should open up a separate etomica applet. It will be titled Piston Cylinder. It will look like a java popup window. 
**Note** There might be an issue with your privacy settings on your Mac, since this is a file downloaded from the internet. You need to override this. To do so: <br/> <br/>
      4a. In order to open the file, navigate to the etomica_modules/bin folder as shown in 1-4. Then execute `sudo ./pistoncylinder`. If prompted, click open by the dialogue box asking if you want to open a file downloaded from an external source. 
5. If this doesn't work for you, contact a TA ASAP because these will be used throughout the class.
